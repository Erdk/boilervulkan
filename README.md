# boilerv

Repositiory with implementation of Vulkan's boilerplate functions. Playground on which I'm learning how different Vulkan components work with each other.

This code was build and tested only on Linux, but it should be easly portable.

## Installation

```
$ # Install g++, glfw and glm devel packages
$ # Download and install Vulkan SDK https://www.lunarg.com/vulkan-sdk/
$ git clone https://github.com/Erdk/boilervulkan
$ cd boilervulkan
$ make
$ make test

```
